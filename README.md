# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: unexpected behavior with styling. The text within a div element should be gray (#999) according to the `text-gray-700` class, but it isn't rendering correctly. 

The bug.js file contains the code snippet with the problem. The bugSolution.js file shows the fix by addressing conflicting styles or correcting class names.

## Bug Description

The text within the div element should display a gray color based on the provided Tailwind CSS classes. However, this does not occur, resulting in unexpected visual output. This might be due to CSS specificity conflicts or an incorrect use of Tailwind classes.

## Solution

The problem is resolved by verifying if any other CSS rules might be overriding the Tailwind classes or ensuring that the class names are correctly spelled and exist within the Tailwind CSS configuration.
